# Usage Notes:
# - Ensure ClickUp API key is provided at configuration time.
# - The server must be built before execution; build artifacts expected in dist/. If your build process outputs to a different directory, update the args accordingly.
# - Project runs as a local MCP server via npx, not published on npm.
